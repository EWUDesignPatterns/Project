<h2>Description</h2>
  
<div class='full'>
  <p>Dungeons and Dragons 21st Century Command Line Style is a game where users create a party, explore a dungeon trying to escape while fighting monsters and gathering treasure.</p>
  <p>Players create a party of three adventurers. These adventurers will be an Elf, Human, or Orc and may train as a Berserker, Cleric, Mage, or Samurai each with it's own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
  <p>Once the party has been created, they begin to explore the dungeon loaded from the map file. Since maps are loaded from a file, additional scenarios can easily be added.</p>
  <p>As the party explores the dungeon they will encounter monsters such as Kobolds, Ogres, Salamanders, and Trolls. Based on the parties' strength, they can choose to flee or attack. Both options use a combination of the characters stats and random numbers to determine whether the action is successful or not.</p>
  <p>The game ends when the party is killed or they successfully find the exit and warn their Kingdom of the impending attack.</p>
